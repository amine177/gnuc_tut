1. Explain the distinction between high levels and low levels
- A high level language creates abstraction over the cpu and memory
- A low level language doesn't get too far from the cpu and memory
inner works and structure (assembly get translated to machine language)
2. What is a "black box"
- A black box is an object which gets input and produces output,
dealing with it needs just understanding its interface, that is
its inputs and outputs
3. Name a few advantages to programming in the C language.
- Small language
- Gives the programmer control over memory -> flexibility
- Doesn't have a huge runtime -> fast
- Portable
