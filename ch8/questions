1. What is the difference between a value parameter and a variable parameter?
- A value parameter just acts as a value and a variable one is a reference
2. What is the difference between a formal parameter and an actual one?
- A formal parameter is a way to create a contract, a form, an actual one
is the prameter on which we apply computation
3. What does passing by reference let you do that passing by value doesn't?
- Passing by reference makes it possible to mutate the actual parameter not
only get a copy of its value
4. Can a function call be used as an actual parameter?
- Yes
5. Do actual and formal parameters need to have the same names?
- No
